        <article class="col-md col-9">
          I occasionally worked on several issues of the music sphere and contributed several articles after conference presentations. Due to lack of time I have not been able to go beyond such a small post. But now is the time. I hope this study will provide the reader with a deeper understanding of this topic. Ethiopian popular music is a pristine area of ​​investigation. Betreyohannes (2008: 14) brings a review of Ethiopian music studies into focus and finds that, unlike traditional music, popular music is the least discussed. He points out that:
        "….AND Although there has been some recent progress in music studies, the existing scholarly literature has focused on church and folk music rather than modern or popular music. Furthermore, discussions of modern music, academic and otherwise, show serious flaws. The reason for insufficient attention and misconceptions of the topic lies at the intersection of two fundamental problems: the lack of a comprehensive historical context
        and conceptual flaws."
        Like other fields of study, music studies are also necessary it plays a significant role in people's lives and lives company. In Ethiopia, research on both traditional and popular music has not yet received adequate attention at the institutional level. Compared to the traditional music domain, popular music in Ethiopia today is still an untouched field of study. In this regard, the country has a long way to go to overcome the shortcomings in musicological (especially ethnomusicological) research. Among the handful of written accounts of popular music in Ethiopia available to us, Francis Falceto delivered to readers a book entitled
        Abyssinia Swing: A Pictorial History of Modern Ethiopian Music(2001).
        Falceto's the thesis contains a comprehensive and concise assessment accompanied by historical images depicting the history of popular music and its development. The book is a standard reference for scholars and interested readers. Other articles written by Falceto largely refer to Ethiopian popular music from a productive and innovative period
        "Golden Years" (1950s - 70s of the 20th century), on which he mainly focuses. Other publications are his informative booklets accompanying more than 30 Ethiopiques CD albums published by the French label Buda Music. As Falceto (2016: 13) makes clear, this was the only song by the famous Mahmoud Ahmed that made him pay attention to Ethiopian music. He wrote
        : "
        …record by Mahmoud Ahmed, Ere mela mela, was more than enough for the music lover that I was. I wanted to learn more about such wonderful music, unknown to me and completely unknown beyond the borders of its country of origin. It was April 1984. A friend had bought this disc from Ethiopia a few years earlier when he was on tour in Africa with a French theater troupe.</article>

        <article class="col-md col-9">
        Each album has an accompanying booklet that provides an in-depth look at its audio content. These albums feature works by highly acclaimed Ethiopian solo artists such as Tilahun Gessesse (vol. 17), Mahmoud Ahmed (vol. 6, 19, 26), Alemayehu Eshete (vol. 9, 22), Tamrat Mola (vol. 24), Ali Birra ( volume 28), Getachew Kassa (volume 14), Emahoy Gebrou (volume 21), Mulatu Astatke (4) and Girma Beyene (30). Several CD albums released at different times contain works by various artists listed as follows:
        -Tekle Tesfa’egzi, Benyene Habte and Tewelde Redda…etc.(volume 5)
        -Muluken Melesse, Teshome Mitiku, Seyfu Yohannes…etc. (Volume 1)
        -Tadele Bekele, Hirut, Bekele, Teferi Feleke…etc. (volume 3)
        -Ferew Hailu,Menelik Wossinachew, Tesfamariam Kidane, etc (volume 10)
        -Tamira Ferenj, Ayalew Mesfin, Bizunesh Bekele… etc. (vol 13)
        -Girma Beyene, Teshome Mitiku/Abubeker Ashike, Mahmoud Ahmed… etc.(volume 20). 
        In addition, the Ethiopiques CD series includes albums of traditional songs. Tracks include works by the following artists:
        - The timeless melodies of Kass Tessem are accompanied by the bowl of the lyra krar. Melodies are e.g.Fanno, Gäläl, Yämusiqa moges ፋኖ፣ ገለል፣ የሙዚቃ ሞገስ(volume 29) 
        - Alemu Aga with religious hymns Abatachin Hoy, Mädina, on Zäläsäña አባታችን ሆይ፣ መዲና፣ ዘለሰኛ…etc. The calm sound of a box lyre bägäna accompanying songs (volume 44) -

        Tigrgna ትግርኛ songs Tsehayitu Beraki, Tiberih Tesfahunegn accompanied crap (Volume 5) 
        - Traditional Konso solo and group songs with and without instrumental accompaniment; instruments: lyre, end flute, bells and other percussive instruments including purely instrumental compositions (volume 12) - Amharic melodies by Asnaqe Gebreyes, Abebe Fekade, Esubalewu Adugna, Zewditu Yohannes with accompaniment masinqo and crap(volume 18) 
        Therefore, Falceto'
        The original goal of sharing rare Ethiopian music with a wider audience has resulted in worldwide distribution and dissemination. Today, Falcet's immeasurable involvement in the research and publication of Ethiopian traditional and popular music has made it possible to preserve the extremely valuable Ethipian musical heritage for future generations.
        Tesfaye Lemma is complex book (2013) titled Ethiopian of music history 1889-1993 (Ethiopian calendar).<a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/930992-Tesfaye-Lemma"><strong>See more about Tesfaye Lemma</strong></a>
        He was one of the great personalities who spread Ethiopian music to the world and his work also contributed to the world of science. Tesfaye takes a closer look at both
        traditional and "modern" musical spheres. Tesafaye was a music composer, lyricist, choreographer (Sutton 2013) and above all a passionate cultural icon and ambassador. During the 1970s, he visited various Ethiopian ethnic groups in different areas of the country. His aim was to study the cultures, social environment and musical traditions of these communities. Thanks to this fieldwork, Tesfaye managed to collect many materials, mainly traditional musical instruments representing all four groups (aerophones, membranophones, chordophones and idiophones). Today, this huge collection of musical instruments is accessible at the Yared School of Music as a permanent exhibit. Today, Addis Ababa University's (AAU) Yared School of Music has preserved this rare collection of musical instruments

        <article class="col-md col-9"> Ethiopian music is a term that can refer to any music of Ethiopian origin, but is often used for the genre, a distinct modal system that is pentatonic, with characteristically long intervals between some notes.
        The music of the Ethiopian highlands uses a basic modal system called qenet, which has four main modes: tezeta, bati, ambassador, and anchihoy. Three other modes are variations of the above: tezeta minor, bati major, and bati minor. When playing traditional instruments, these modes are generally not tempered (meaning the pitches may deviate slightly from the Western tuning system), but when playing Western instruments such as pianos and guitars, they are played using Western tuning system. The most prominent internationally recognized singers are Aster Aweke, Alemayehu Eshete, Gigi, Teddy Afro, Tilahun Gessesse and Mahmoud Ahmed. Tilahun Gessesse was popular throughout the 20th century and nicknamed "The Voice" because of his extended tenor vocals. In 2001, Teddy Afro debuted with his album Abugida and quickly became a famous singer of his generation, nicknamed "Blatenaw" (English: The boy). Some commentators have also compared Teddy Afro to Tilahun Gessesse in terms of musical style and patriotic sensibilities. Through her performances with leading Western jazz musicians such as Bill Laswell (who is also her husband) and Herbie Hancock, Gigi brought Ethiopian music to popular attention, especially in the United States, where she now lives. Through her 1999 album Hagere and 'Abebayesh', Aster Aweke is known for her voice which has attracted a wider audience. Another notable singer is Neway Debebe who was very popular among the youth in the 1980s and early 1990s with such songs as “Yetekemt Abeba”, “Metekatun Ateye”, “Safsaf” and “Gedam” among others. Abatte Barihun exemplifies all four major qenets on his 2005 album Ras Deshen.

          Recent years, new music genres have been introduced, popular in Western countries, such as EDM, rock and hip hop. Musicians such as the Jano Band play a new style of progressive rock music with a mix of Ethiopian music.[16] Hip hop music began to influence Ethiopian music in the early to mid-2000s, culminating in the creation of Ethiopian hip hop, rhyming in the native Amharic language. The earliest and most influential hip hop rappers were Teddy Yo and Lij Michael, with the latter being more commercially successful. The success of both Jano Band and Lij Michael led to their inclusion in the 2017 edition of Coke Studio Africa[16] Electronic dance music in Ethiopia was not fully developed until the mid-2010s, although some use of electronic music with a hip hop element began in the year 2000. In 2018, a DJ and musician named Rophann introduced his own version of electronic dance music to the country, winning Album of the Year and further changing the mainstream music scene.
